# 🌟 From Microbes to ML Models 🌟  

## 👋 About Me  

I’m a **Chemical Engineering graduate** with over a decade of experience spanning **Quality and Process Engineering** roles in the **food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries**, and most recently as a **Senior Manager of Sanitation** working in meat processing facilities across Canada.

🔧 **Process & Quality Engineering:** I drove improvements and safeguarded compliance across highly regulated industries. Highlights include:  
- 👥 **Leading cross-functional teams** to solve technical problems and implement sustainable process improvements.
- 📉 **Reducing waste** and **optimizing production efficiency** through Lean and Six Sigma-inspired initiatives.
- 🏭 **Designing process controls** that balanced efficiency, safety, and product quality in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic manufacturing.  
- 🧪 **Ensuring regulatory compliance** with CFIA and GMP standards while maintaining operational excellence. 
- 📊 **Developing data-driven KPIs** to measure quality outcomes and continuously improve performance. 

🧼 **Sanitation Leadership:** I directed sanitation and food safety programs across **multiple facilities**. Highlights included:  
- 🧴 **Standardizing cleaning and hygiene practices** to meet **CFIA** and **USDA** requirements. 
- 🦠 Leading **Listeria and Salmonella investigations** and implementing **preventative controls** in raw and ready-to-eat environments.
- 💧 Tackling **water pressure drops** during peak sanitation.
- 📊 Building **KPI frameworks and auditing systems** to hold **chemical suppliers** and **contractors** accountable, driving measurable improvements across the network. 

Throughout my career, one theme stood out: **data was always my most powerful tool**. Whether it was uncovering root causes, improving KPIs, or streamlining processes, I relied on data-driven insights to deliver results.  

That realization inspired my pivot into **Data Science 🚀**.  

I began with the **Lighthouse Labs Data Science Diploma program**, which was unfortunately cut short when the school declared bankruptcy. Determined to continue, I **self-learned, built projects, and ultimately pursued a formal Data Science diploma** at **BrainStation** to strengthen my expertise and credentials.  

💡 **My goal:** To leverage this hybrid background in industries where **data, quality, and efficiency intersect** — from supply chain analytics to healthcare modeling to predictive risk management.
